## Arona - A clan battle oriented discord bot for World of Warships
Add it to your server with this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1360295816476098692&permissions=139586750464&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)

It is recommended that you create a special channel where Arona can log events in.

Bot theme is based on [Blue Archive](https://www.nexon.com/main/en/Blue%20Archive/details)

## Commands and features
### Success Factor
Success Factor (S/F) is an experimental statistics ratio aiming to show a clans overall success over a CB season.

The hope is that S/F could give a new perspective on a clans position on the leaderboards.
<br> For example, S/F could determine whether a clan spammed games or put in actual effort to reach their position on the leaderboards.

Formula: 
  
$\Large \frac{\frac{rating^{L}}{15} \times \frac{rating}{battles}}{10}$

where L is based on what league the clan currently resides in.

| League  | Exponent (L) value |
|---------|--------------------|
|Hurricane|1                   |
|Typhoon  |0.8                 |
|Storm    |0.6                 |
|Gale     |0.4                 |
|Squall   |0.2                 |

Since exponent is different per league, each league would have their own ranges on what's considered "good" or "bad" S/F.
