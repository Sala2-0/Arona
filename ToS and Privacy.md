# Terms of Service
Last updated: 2025-11-28

This Terms of Service (“Terms”) governs your use of Arona (“the Bot”).
By using the Bot, you agree to these Terms as well as [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) of [Discord](https://discord.com). If you do not agree, you may remove the Bot from your server and stop using it.

The Bot is not affiliated, supported nor endorsed by Wargaming Group Ltd or World of Warships.

## Service description
The Bot provides Discord servers with features related to World of Warships clan battles, including:

- Displaying publicly available clan information through WG APIs
- Automated live clan battle tracking with a built-in minimum delay
- Optional detailed clan battle end results (requires user-provided WG account cookie)
- Server-specific configurations for tracking and display

## Public Live Game Data
Any live clan battle information displayed by the Bot is already publicly accessible on the official World of Warships clan pages and other WG services. The Bot simply automates the process.

To prevent potential misuse (e.g., queue dodging concerns), the Bot enforces a minimum 5-minute delay on recent battle data.

## User Accounts and Cookies
Certain features require users to voluntarily submit their World of Warships account cookie.

By doing so, you acknowledge and agree that:
- You understand the risks of sharing any account cookie.
- You should only provide cookies from low-rank (“alt”) accounts, not from your main account.
- The Bot only accepts cookies from accounts with the lowest clan rank.
- Using the cookie allows the Bot to access the same clan-restricted information that the provided account can access, and nothing more.
- The Bot and consequently the owner cannot:
  - Change your account login
  - Rename your account or clan
  - Take ownership of your account
  - Perform actions requiring password or e-mail confirmation

## Revoking Access
You may revoke the Bot’s access at any time by logging out of the browser session used to extract the cookie. This immediately invalidates the cookie.

## Content and Data Accuracy
The Bot relies on third-party APIs and may occasionally display incomplete, delayed, or inaccurate data.
The Bot is provided “as-is” with no guarantees regarding availability, accuracy, or reliability.

## User Responsibilities
You agree not to:
- Attempt to use the Bot for competitive abuse beyond its intended functionality
- Provide unauthorized or high-privilege cookies

## Data Storage
The Bot stores only minimal technical data required for operation (see Privacy Policy).
You may remove the Bot from your server at any time to stop further data collection.

## Availability and Termination
The owner may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Bot at any time.

## Limitation of Liability
The Bot is offered for free and without guarantees.
To the maximum extent allowed by law, I am not responsible for:
- Account losses due to improper cookie handling
- Inaccurate data from WG services
- Any damages arising from misuse of the Bot
- Interruptions, bugs, or data processing errors

## Contact
Contant with the owner can be achieved through Discord (sala2.0)

## Changes to These Terms
Owner of the Bot may update these Terms. Continued use of the Bot after updates means you accept the new version.

## Information the Bot Collects
### A. Automatically Stored Data
When the Bot is used on a Discord server for the first time, it stores:
- Server ID
- Channel ID (for bot output locations)

This is required for the Bot to remember where to send notifications and use its features.

### B. Optional Data (User-Provided Cookie)
Some advanced features require users to voluntarily provide a WG account cookie.

This cookie is used only to access:
- Detailed post-battle clan results
- Information that is already available to the account used
- Clan-specific data (not personal data)
- Cookies are stored securely and never shared with third parties.

The Bot automatically rejects cookies from accounts with high clan privileges and only accepts cookies from the lowest clan rank.

## How the Data Is Used
Data is used only to:
- Provide bot functionality
- Display clan tracking information
- Retrieve detailed clan battle results for the clan the submitted account belongs to
- Maintain configuration for each server
- Improve reliability and performance

Data is not shared with third-parties.

## Data Retention
Server IDs and Channel IDs are stored until the Bot is removed from the server.
Cookies remain valid until:
- They naturally expire,
- The user logs out (invalidating the cookie), or
- The user requests removal

You may request cookie deletion manually at any time.

## Changes to This Policy
Owner of the Bot may update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Bot after updates signifies acceptance.
